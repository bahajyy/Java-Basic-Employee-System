# Java-Basic-Employee-System

This Java application manages employees’ information like employee number, name, age, gender, and salary.
Employees are divided into casual and full-time.
A casual employee works for $20 per hour.
Whatever the type of employee is, all entries are written to the txt file of that type. (i.e., casual.txt or fulltime.txt)

At the end of each operation, the menu will appear until the user wants to exit. 
1. Enter an employee record
2. Read all employee records
0. Exit
When the user wants to add a new employee to the file, 
the system must first ask which employee type to add.
When the user enters all the new employee’s information, the system should write the new user to the relevant file.

If the user wants to see all employees, the system should read and print data from both full-time and casual employees' files.
